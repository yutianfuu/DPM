# Lab 4 Navigation

See instructions on MyCourses and read the general guidelines on the
[website](https://mcgill-dpm.github.io/website/).

Follow the **design process** described in this course in order to implement this lab.
You could be asked to explain parts of your process during the demo.

1. Work with your partner to understand the requirements of this lab,
   and come up with a high-level design for the `turnTo()` and the `travelTo()` methods.
   This can be in the form of pseudocode, a simple diagram, or a written description.
   Validate this high-level design before running any code on the robot by considering different inputs, including edge cases.
2. Test your design by running your logic on your computer using the inputs you used in step 1. See the FAQ for an example.
3. Add code to make your logic control the robot.
4. Using the `Navigation` methods you implemented, write a program to travel through a set of waypoints. See Fig. 2 in the handout for examples.
5. Adjust the parameters of your controller, if any, to minimize the distance between the desired destination and the final position of the robot.
   Simultaneously, you should aim to minimize the number of oscillations made by the robot around its destination before stopping.
