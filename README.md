* ### Lab1: Wall Following
   Design and implement a wall following system that can navigate around a sequence of blocks and obstacles that form a wall containing gaps, concave corners, and convex corners.
* ### Lab2: Odometry
   Design and implement an Odometry system that provides a robotâ€™s position and orientation, allowing it to autonomously navigate a field.
* ### Lab3: Localization
   Design a system to localize the robot using ultrasonic and light sensors, where the robot should move to a known starting position.
